## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Log Food Items**  
   - Users manually input food items or scan barcodes.
   - Each entry includes the purchase date, type of food, and storage method.

2. **AI Expiry Prediction**  
   - The AI model estimates expiry based on:
     - Food type (e.g., dairy, produce, dry goods)
     - Storage conditions (e.g., refrigerated, pantry)
     - Historical shelf-life data

3. **Notification System**  
   - Sends timely alerts as items approach predicted expiry.
   - Differentiates between “Best Before” and “Use By” to avoid unnecessary disposal.

4. **Smart Recipe Engine**  
   - Suggests recipes using foods that are close to expiring.
   - Integrates with external APIs to provide a wide range of meal ideas.

5. **Educational Insights**  
   - Shows which foods are still safe past expiry.
   - Teaches users to interpret labeling better.

6. **Waste Analytics**  
   - Tracks what you consume vs. waste.
   - Offers tips to improve food usage efficiency.
